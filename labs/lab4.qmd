By the end of the lab, you will...

-   use regular expressions to build a data frame summarizing thousands of emails for the purposes of text classification in a future lab

::: callout-warning
Make sure everyone in your team knows when to stop committing! After 5pm on the due date will result in late penalty applying for the team, even if commit is "accidentally" pushed.
:::

# Getting started

-   In the *terminal* tab, type `cd ~` to navigate to your home directory. Next `git clone git@github.com:sta323-sp23/lab-4-team_name.git` where `team_name` is replaced with your team name (see the excel signup sheet in box or your github).

-   Navigate to your `lab-4` folder and open the `.Rproj` file.

-   Open the Quarto (`.qmd`) file, change the author name to your team name followed by a colon and then the names of the team members.

## Exercises

For all exercises, you should respond in the space provided in the template `lab-4.qmd`. Any task that says "print to the screen", or "glimpse the data frame" etc. should be reproduced in your `qmd` and be visible upon rendering.

::: callout-note
In this lab, there is only one exercise.

## Exercise

### Goal

The goal of this exercise is to build a data set for use in a future lab. The ultimate goal is to build an algorithm to classify which "class" each document belongs to.

### Data

There are 4989 documents. Each document is an email from one of 5 email listservs (news groups), that, as far as I can tell, were all hosted at Carnegie Mellon University in the early 90s. The original data set (with a total of 20 news groups) can be found [here](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/). This data set is a popular choice for experiments in text classification and clustering. Please note the following warning: similar to many modern forums on the internet, the emails in this data set may contain profanity and offensive language. I do not condone, endorse nor promote any language, views or content expressed within this data set.

### Task

We will comb through 12013 documents and construct a single data frame from these documents for use in a future lab. Our goal is to create a data frame that looks like the following:

![](img/document_example_df.png){fig-align="center"}

where the column `Document` contains the documents name or #, `Newsgroup` contains the category the document belongs to, `total_words` contains the total words in the document, `word_1`, `word_2` up to `word_v` contains every word in every document and the values represent the number of occurrences of each given word in the document.

To make this task more manageable, let's break this into smaller tasks below:

#### part 1

Read in the data from the file `37916` with, e.g. `readLines`, e.g. `x = readLines("pathToFile/37916")`. Write a regular expression to identify the "Newsgroup" from the text. Save the result as an object called `newsgroup_id`. Print `newsgroup_id` to the screen.

::: callout-tip
## Hint

Some documents (emails) are featured in multiple newsgroups, separated by a ",". In this case, you should return a character vector of the newsgroups like below:

```{r}
#| eval: true
"rec.autos,rec.autos.tech" %>%
  str_split(",") %>% 
  unlist()
```
:::

#### part 2

Identify which part of the document is the body of the email. Write a regular expression to extract each word (alphanumeric) from the body of the email. Save a **character vector** of words in the email as an object called `words_in_email`. Print `words_in_email` to the screen.

::: callout-tip
## Hint

1.  Find which entry has "Lines:"
2.  Subset the document `x` to only be what occurs after this entry.
3.  Extract each word followed by a break.
:::

#### part 3

Save your result from part 1 and 2 into a list like so:

```{r}
#| eval: false

i = 37916

doc_i = list(
  "doc_id" = paste("doc", i, sep = "_"),
  "Newsgroup" = newsgroup_id,
  "words" = words_in_email
)
```

and then write a for loop, using the template code below as a starting point to make a list of lists for each document.

```{r}
#| eval: false

all_docs = list.files("/data/newsgroups_5")
  
doc_words = list()
# begin for loop over i in all_docs 

  # read in doc i
  # create newsgroup_id
  # create words_in_email
  # put both together in a list called doc_i

  doc_words[[paste("doc", i, sep = "_")]] = doc_i
  
# end for loop
```

Print the first three lists inside of `doc_words` using the code below:

```{r}
#| eval: false
doc_words[1:3] %>% 
  str()
```

::: callout-tip
## Hint

Use `paste` or `paste0` to concatenate the filepath and filenames as you read them in.
:::

#### part 4

Using the appropriate lookup functions from `purrr` (see lecture on functional programming) turn your list of lists `doc_words` into a tibble called `doc_words_df` that looks like the data frame pictured below. While building your data frame, remove all documents for which there are **multiple newsgroups**. Print the first 10 rows to the screen **and** glimpse your resulting data frame. There should be **3924** rows and **5** columns.\
\

![](images/example-tibble-lab4.png){fig-align="center"}

#### part 5

Unnest columns, re-order them and remove any extra columns as appropriate to make your data frame match our goal data frame from the [task section](#task) above. Your final data frame should have 3924 rows

## Style guidelines

All assignments in this course must employ proper coding style, as outlined below:

-   All code should obey the 80 character limit per line (i.e. no code should run off the page when rendering or require scrolling). To enable a vertical line in the RStudio IDE that helps guide this, see the style guidelines from lab 0 or ask a member of the teaching team for help.

-   All commas should be followed by a space.

-   All binary operators should be surrounded by space. For example `x + y` is appropriate. `x+y` is not.

-   All pipes `%>%` or `|>` as well as ggplot layers `+` should be followed by a new line.

-   You should be consistent with stylistic choices, e.g. only use 1 of `=` vs `<-` and `%>%` vs `|>`

-   Your name should be at the top (in the YAML) of each document under "author:"

-   All code chunks should be named (with names that don't have spaces, e.g. `ex-1`, `ex-2` etc.)

-   File names in your GitHub repo such as `lab-x.qmd` must not be changed and left as provided. Additionally, your repo must pass certain basic checks. The results of these checks are visible on GitHub via the badges at the top of your README and the actions tab. These are meant to give you feedback around the structure and reproducibility of your repository and assignment - they do not assess the correctness of your work. You should consider them a necessary but not sufficient condition when turning in your work - passing all of the checks simply means your have met a minimum standard of reproducibility for the assignment.

Fundamentally, the check is making sure 1) you only have the files you should in your repository, 2) your `.qmd` renders.

If you have any questions about style, please ask a member of the teaching team.

## Submitting your lab

To submit your assignment, simply commit and push your completed `lab-x.qmd` to your GitHub repo. Your most recent commit 48 hours after the assignment deadline will be graded, and any applicable late penalty will be applied (see [the syllabus](/syllabus.html)). For this reason, **do not push commits** after you are satisfied with your work, or a late penalty will be applied.
