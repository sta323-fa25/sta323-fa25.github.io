# quiz 1

::: panel-tabset
### Exercise 1

Is `x` a list or an atomic vector?

```{r}
#| eval: false
x = c(1L, 1)
```

### Solution

`x` is an atomic vector. Specifically, `1L` is coerced to type double due to `c()`.

```{r}
x = c(1L, 1)
typeof(x)
```

### Exercise 2

The output below is the result of printing object `y` to the screen. Is `y` a list or an atomic vector?

```{r}
#| echo: false
f = function(x) {
  return(x ^ 2)
}

list(3, f)
```

### Solution

`y` is a list because it has heterogeneous elements. The first element is the double `3` while the second element is a function.

### Exercise 3
What is the output of the following code chunk:

```{r}
#| eval: false
TRUE | NA
```

### Solution

```{r}
#| echo: false
TRUE | NA
```

### Exercise 4

What's a **generic**?

### Solution

A generic is a function that dispatches to other class-specific functions depending on the class of the argument.

### Exercise 1

`select()` returns a ___

### Solution

data frame or `tibble`

:::

::: panel-tabset

### Exercise 2

`%>%` and `|>` are both ___

### Solution

pipes
:::

::: panel-tabset

### Exercise 3

`mutate()` creates a new ___

### Solution

column
:::

::: panel-tabset

### Exercise 4

TRUE or FALSE: a tidy data frame has individual observations on the rows, variables on the columns and values in each cell.


### Solution

`TRUE`

### Exercise 1
The `gg` in ggplot stands for ___ of ___.

### Solution

grammar of graphics
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Exercise 2
To create a scatter plot with `ggplot2`, I need to add the geometry geom_[___]

### Solution
point, `geom_point()`
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Exercise 3

TRUE or FALSE: to change the color of a plot, based on the column `var1` of the data set, I need to put `color = var1` *inside* the aesthetic `aes()` function. To change the color of all points to red, regardless of the data, I should put `color = 'red'` *outside* the aesthetic function.

### Solution
`TRUE`
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Exercise 4
What's wrong with the code below?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
#| error: true
#| eval: false

cars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dist)) 
  geom_histogram()
```

### Solution
Missing a `+` to connect ggplot layers.

# quiz 4

::: panel-tabset

### Exercise 1

true or false: Newton's method, $x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$, iterates to find extrema of function $f$.

### Solution

false

:::

::: panel-tabset

### Exercise 2

true or false: Newton's method always converges to the same point, regardless of starting position $x_0$.

### Solution

false

# quiz 5

::: panel-tabset

### Exercise 1

What does MM stand for?

### Solution

majorize-minimize or minorize-maximize (accept either or both)

:::

::: panel-tabset

### Exercise 2

What are the two conditions a surrogate function must satisfy in an MM algorithm?

### Solution

In majorize-minimize, the surrogate must satisfy tangency:

$$
g(\theta_n|\theta_n) = f(\theta_n)
$$
and $g$ must minorize $f$,

$$
g(\theta |\theta_n) \leq f(\theta) \ \forall \ \theta
$$

(In the case of majorization-minimization, $g$ must majorize $f$.)

### Exercise 1

Monte Carlo integration is most useful for low-dimensional integrals (`TRUE` or `FALSE`)?

### Solution

`FALSE`

:::

::: panel-tabset

### Exercise 2

Describe in 1 or 2 sentences how the following image is an example of using Monte Carlo integration to estimate $\pi$.

![](../quizzes/img/MonteCarlo.png)

### Solution

The can estimate $\pi$ by integrating to find the area of the unit circle. We map the integration problem to computing the mean number of points that fall in the circle when uniformly placing points in the box.
