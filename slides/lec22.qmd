# Cryptanalysis

## Basic terminology

-   cryptography: making secret messages (encryption)
    -   substitution
    -   transposition
-   cryptanalysis: breaking secret messages (decryption)
-   cryptology: the study of cryptography and cryptanalysis

. . .

-   plain text: the actual message
-   cipher text: the encrypted message
-   key: information to encode (or decode) cryptographic key
  - symmetric (same key for encryption and decryption)
  - asymmetric (different key to encrypt and decrypt)

## Motivation

[Diaconis, Persi. "The markov chain monte carlo revolution." Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 46.2 (2009): 179-205.](https://math.uchicago.edu/~shmuel/Network-course-readings/MCMCRev.pdf)

## Substitution cipher

-   Idea: each character of plaintext is substitude with another character

. . .

Example:

From <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher>

## Exercise

- Given the message below is encoded with a substitution cipher, how many possible keys are there?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
secret_message = readLines("../data/ciphertext.txt")
```


```{r}
secret_message
```

- Trying every possible key is known as a "brute force" approach. Chat with your neighbor and develop a strategy better than the brute force approach.

- Continue the exercise by downloading the file below

```{r}
#| eval: false
download.file(url = "https://sta323-sp23.github.io/scripts/cryptanalysis.qmd",
              destfile = "cryptanalysis.qmd")
```
